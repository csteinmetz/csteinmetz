Hi, I’m Charles Steinmetz

I’m the solo builder behind PinocchioAI, a patent-backed orchestration engine for AI personas that speak, reason, remember, and adapt across time.

What I’m Building
	•	Grace: A QA coaching persona for contact centers, capable of memory-aware feedback, tone analysis, and real-time behavior modeling
	•	PinocchioAI: The orchestration method that enables AI agents to retain identity, emotional continuity, and scene context across interactions
	•	Agentic Orchestration™: My term for coordinating AI behavior beyond prompts — grounded in memory, identity, and purpose

My Stack
	•	Backend: Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Postgres, APScheduler
	•	Frontend: React, Tailwind, Vite (for demos and control UIs)
	•	LLM / AI: OpenAI GPT-4o, ElevenLabs, vector DBs (Weaviate planned)
	•	Infra: Render, Docker (local dev), GitHub Actions (light)

Why This Matters

I’m focused on making AI useful and believable in real-world roles—starting with agent coaching, but applicable across entertainment, HR, and CX.

My work is grounded in production logic, not just prompt play. If you’re building AI personas, coaching tools, or human-AI systems, I’m always open to share notes.
